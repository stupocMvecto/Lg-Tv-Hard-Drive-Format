# Lg Tv Hard Drive Format
  
If you don't see the drive listed on the top or an Initialize Disk window appears, it probably means that the hard drive is new and has not yet been partitioned. Partitioning is something that must be done before a hard drive is formatted.

Drive letters are assigned during the Windows partitioning process but can easily be changed after the format is complete. You can change drive letters after the formatting process is done if you'd like.
 
Just as the warning says, all the information on this drive will be erased if you continue. You can't cancel the format process halfway through and expect to have half of your data back. As soon as this starts, there's no going back. There's no reason for this to be scary but we do want you to understand the finality of a format.
 
You may notice that now that the format is complete, the volume label has changed to what you set it as (New Drive in our case) and the % Free is listed at 100%. There's a little overhead involved so don't worry if your drive isn't empty.

Thank you. I will try your suggestions. This HD has not been used from a previous Tablo. I am new to Tablo! The HD is an extra Western Digital 2TB external I had on hand. What I meant is, it was placed on the Tablo before any other connections were placed as instructed in the manual. I cleaned it up earlier and removed all my files(except the drivers) and am ready to dedicate it to this new Tablo. Will the new format take away the WD drivers and make it unusable on Windows in the future?
 
Yes, the drive will be formatted with the ext4 format which is not natively readable in Windows. It can be reformatted in the future if you no longer wish to use it on your Tablo and wish to use it in Windows again.

Would this work if I reformatted only my system drive (dropbox is synced to another drive) Reinstall Dropbox (latest) and point the sync directory to the old one?

I did this before on another PC and it never stops "indexing" the icon remains on sync with thousands of files but never really changes so I can't see if any new downloading files are actually being downloaded or not.
 
I am trying to connect an external hard drive into the eSATA port in the back. I have tried to format the drive with NTFS, but the ReadyNas doesn't see it. If I connect it using a USB setup i get the message an external device is connected but not reconzied by the ReadyNas. Looking to see if I need to chnage the format to use the eSATA port in the back.
 
The NAS will format it to a BTRFS volume, which you are unlikely to be able to read with other devices. So if you have a need to do that, you'll need to use a USB drive, which can be formatted to NTFS.
 
The only issue is when i recieve the "External device is connected but is not reconzied by the ReadyNas" I navigate to the overview section on the admin page the drive isn't there to format. Ive plugged it into my computer completly whiped it a few times and formatted it to NTFS. Now each time after I format the drive to NTFS I try the eSATA port first to see if it see it at all and nothing. I might just have to re-format the drive again with NTFS and ditch trying to get it to connect through the eSATA port.
 
Combination of all three options should give you enough info to draw your conclusions, whether the disk is broken or incompatibel, you might have a problem with your cable or the nas itself is causing the issue.
 
Aside from the primary C drive (C:), you can also format an internal drive or an external hard drive. Your Windows hard drive may be partitioned into several different drives. Smaller internal drives with names like D, E, F, etc. are your **internal drives**. An **external drive** is hardware like a USB drive or another external storage device.
 
If you need to format a drive to use a different file system, you can quickly do that from the Windows Explorer screen. Just right-click on the drive and select **Format**. From there, you can select NTFS, FAT32, or exFAT.
 
Why is Windows maintenance necessary? During the normal computing process, Windows accumulates a ton of junk that slows it down: residual files, leftover installers, temporary files, cached data, and more.
 
On Windows, your **primary hard drive or C drive (C:)** is the internal hard disk where the operating system (OS) resides. You may also have additional **internal drives** to store more files on your computer. This happens when your disk is **partitioned**(separated) between the primary drive and additional internal drives.
 
An **external hard drive**is located outside of your computer, and it can be a flash drive (also called thumb drive or USB) or a larger drive that can contain either a solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk drive (HDD).
 
With basic file security and support for files over 4 GB in size, NTFS is the best option when transferring large files. If you want to put a movie on a USB drive to play it on your TV, you should use NTFS. Also, NTFS lets you set helpful advanced permissions.
 
The steps to format external drives and flash drives (also called thumb drives and USB drives) are the same as formatting internal drives. That means that learning how to format an external hard drive is fairly straightforward.
 
**Normal format (also called reformat):**Erases your files and completely wipes the drive, making it much more difficult to recover. This is the best option if you want to sell or give away your computer or external storage device.
 
**Start from scratch:**If things are no longer working on your machine, you can format the drive and reinstall the OS to try to create a new computer environment. Make sure to back up the files you need (or clone your hard drive) before you start formatting.
 
**Delete:** Deleting data just moves it into a folder, out of sight, like the Recycle Bin in Windows or the Trash on Mac. While in that folder, the files can be recovered easily. If you empty the Recycle Bin or Trash, the files can then be overwritten by new data.
 
When your device needs to save new data, it can (and will) use the space occupied by the deleted files. Before they get overwritten, though, you can still recover deleted files using data recovery software. The more recently the files were deleted, the easier it is to recover them.
 
Over time, your hard drive becomes cluttered with temporary files, cached data, duplicate files, apps you never use, and other junk files. All that clutter will slow down your computer and can cause crashes and freezes.

So my question is: how is this done right, and has anyone done this? Have you then filled up the drive and deleted some files to make space finding that everything works like a real r/w format even though it seems to have been primarily a write once format?
 
Call me crazy but I'd really like it if the UDF system would also automount and be writable by the logged in user. What I've tried so far (udftools formatting as mentioned by kicsyromy) doesn't address this wish.
 
**Windows 7** have full support up to UDF v2.6, but the UDF block size must match the block size of the underlying device (which for USB-sticks and most disks is 512 bytes; "advanced format" disks are 4096 bytes). Apparently the disk must be partitioned.
 
As explained above, for USB harddisks, Windows requires the disk to be partitioned. On the other side, UDF only works in OS X when it is used on a full disk (unpartitioned). Rather surprisingly, there is a solution which works for both: having the disk partitioned and unpartitioned at the same time.
 
The nice thing is that UDF does not (I suppose deliberately) use the first few kilobytes of the partition or disk it is placed on, so this place can really be used to store a legacy partition table, referring to a partition that spans the whole disk. Some testing shows that this really works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X:
 
I am unclear whether this has to do with the difficulties I had mounting it read/write on OSX, but after deleting a certain number of files using Linux, I was never able to mount the drive again on OSX.
 
It would seem there are ways I can use a **NTFS** volume to achieve a balance between the features of a modern file system, Unix-style permissions - I might be able to set them - and read/write mount on all operating systems.
 
I just tested this out in a VM. It seems that you need to (re)create your partition in Windows assign it a drive letter but don't format it to any filesystem. After that boot into Ubuntu and just follow the directions and it should work for read/write.
 
I want to format one of my hard drives for NTFS from the OMV web UI, but given that NTFS is not an option in the "Create File System" list, I am somewhat lost right now. Could someone point me in the right direction? Thanks!
 
I actually solved this problem by just pulling the drive and formatting it for NTFS on Windows, but it would be nice to know how to do this on Linux in the future. I tried using mkntifs -f /dev/sdx, and while it worked, the file system, would not mount in OMV.
